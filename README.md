# 🤖 AI Chatbot: Leveraging Open-Source LLMs for Intelligent Conversations

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to our innovative project that utilizes **open-source Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create powerful and engaging chatbots! These chatbots are designed to understand and generate human-like text, making them ideal for a variety of applications, from customer support to personal assistants. By harnessing the capabilities of models like GPT-3, BERT, and others, we can build conversational agents that not only respond accurately but also provide contextually relevant information.

Open-source LLMs have transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, enabling developers to create customizable and scalable solutions. With libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers, building a chatbot has never been easier. These models are trained on vast datasets, allowing them to perform complex language tasks such as answering questions, summarizing content, and engaging in meaningful dialogue.

### Step 1: Installing Requirements
- 🛠️ Install necessary libraries and dependencies using:
### Step 2: Import Required Tools
📦 Import essential tools from libraries
### Step 3: Choosing a Model
🤖 Select the appropriate LLM model for your chatbot.

### Step 4: Fetch the Model and Initialize a Tokenizer
🔍 Load the model and tokenizer:
### Step 5: Chat
💬 Start the conversation loop:
- Step 5.1: Keeping Track of Conversation History  
  📜 Maintain a list to store conversation history.  
- Step 5.2: Encoding the Conversation History  
  🔄 Encode the conversation history for processing.  
- Step 5.3: Fetch Prompt from User  
  🗣️ Get input from the user.  
- Step 5.4: Tokenization of User Prompt and Chat History  
  🔑 Tokenize the input and history.  
- Step 5.5: Generate Output from Model  
  ⚡ Generate a response from the model.  
- Step 5.6: Decode Output  
  🔍 Decode the model's output to get the response text.  
- Step 5.7: Update Conversation History  
  📝 Append the new user prompt and model response to the conversation history.  


### Step 6: Repeat
🔄 Continue the chat loop for ongoing interaction.
